# SFTPPipeline
## This program packages together common files that are uploaded to SFTP Servers into a container called a “Preset.” It keeps records of SFTP Server connection information so that Presets can be uploaded to more than one SFTP Server dynamically as well as providing functionality for scheduling automatic uploads. Additionally, it provides the user with a clean graphical user interface so they can easily interact with the application.
