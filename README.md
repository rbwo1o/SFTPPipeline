# SFTPPipeline
This program simplifies the process of uploading common files to SFTP servers by packaging them into a container called a 'Preset'. The program saves SFTP connection information and allows for dynamic uploads to multiple servers at the same time. Additionally, it includes a scheduling feature for automatic uploads and a clean graphical user interface for easy interaction. With this program, users can streamline their SFTP file transfer process saving time and effort.
